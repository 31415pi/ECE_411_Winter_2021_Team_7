Practicum Homework #3: Product Design Specification (PDS)

Create a PDS for your practicum project, and upload it to your collaboration site. Suggested (that’s a should, not a must!) sections should include:

#● Executive Summary / Concept of Operations
##○ A brief summary of your device. What does it do? Why? Who uses it? How do they use it?
After reading this, the reader should have an understanding of your device and the context in which it's used.



#● Brief Market Analysis
##○ Who are the intended customers?
##○ What is the competition? Why is your product different?
##○ What price will do you think you can sell this for, and why? (keep it short, we're engineers, not marketing researchers)



#● Requirements
##○ Requirements are: Abstract, Verifiable, Unambiguous, Traceable, Realistic
##○ Think "10,000 ft" view of what is required. E.g., "must be portable", "must measure voltage but should measure current", must last 1 hour, etc.
##○ Remember, you're defining the requirements, not the solution.
##○ Feel free to use either "must" or "must, should, may"



#● System Architecture
##○ This is your proposed design, from a high level.
##○ Create a Level 1 block diagram: one block per major section (e.g., processor, input, output, power supply, etc) with interconnections in between them. Label all interconnections. Label all blocks. If it makes sense to put the part number in the block, go ahead.



#● Design Specification
##○ OK, now put in the technical details on the design.
##○ A list of bullet points is fine here: What is the sensor? Processor? Actuator? Power? Mechanical design? Firmware? Arduino or no? Development environment?



#Misc Notes:
##● This should only be 2-3 pages.
##● Pictures are good, when useful. Gratuitous pictures are not good.
##● Please format this nicely, spell check it, and write it in a direct, simple, active voice.
